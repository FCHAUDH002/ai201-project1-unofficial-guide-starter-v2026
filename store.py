"""
Stages 3 and 4 of the pipeline: embedding chunks and retrieving them.

Three things in here are worth knowing about, because they'd quietly break the
rest of the project if they were wrong:

1. The Chroma collection is created with cosine distance, explicitly. Chroma
   defaults to squared L2, and the 0.6 threshold the course uses is calibrated
   against cosine. Getting this wrong makes every distance number meaningless.

2. `search` returns the distance alongside each chunk. Milestone 4 has you
   compare distances, so they have to be visible.

3. The embedding model is the one Chroma bundles, not one loaded through
   `sentence-transformers`. It is the same model — `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, 384
   dimensions — but it arrives as an ONNX build from Chroma's own CDN, so the
   install needs neither PyTorch nor a reachable Hugging Face. See `_embedder`.
